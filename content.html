    <h1>Design Projects</h1>
    <h2>Book Cover</h2>
     <img src="assets/book mock up.jpg" alt="Picture of book cover" width="600" height="auto"/>
<p>I redesigned a book cover for an existing book. I chose to redesign 
the cover for the book <i>Six Crimson Cranes</i> by Elizabeth Lim. I wanted to give the cover a more serious tone than the original so I went with a black, red, and white color scheme. 
I first started out making illustrations for the front and back in Adobe Fresco. I then went into Indesign and added a red border along with text to contrast with the black and white illustrations.
Overall, I really enjoyed taking a light-hearted fantasy novel and redesigning the cover so it had a darker and more mature vibe.</p>

<h2>Tesla Annual Report</h2>

<p>I designed a booklet for Tesla based on their 2023 annual shareholder report. For the design, I wanted to focus on the aspect of Tesla being a luxury vehicle. 
Instead of going for a friendlier tone, I went with a dark and cold theme. I wanted the brand to feel more high-end and exclusive for this report booklet.</p>

<h2>Mobile App</h2>

<p>The goal was to use research to create a design solution for a 
problem of our choice. I chose to design an app that simplifies the 
research process for finding trails. I designed an app that caters to outdoor enthusiasts and athletes. 
For the design, I went with a natural yet energetic tone, incorporating colors like bright orange and dark greens.
